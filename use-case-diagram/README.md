# 🏠 Airbnb Clone – Use Case Diagram

## 📌 Objective
A use case diagram that visualizes the interactions between users and the backend system of the Airbnb Clone project.

The goal is to clearly define how different actors (Guest, Host, and Admin) interact with key system features such as registration, booking, property management, and payments.

## 👤 Actors
- **Guest**: Can register, log in, search listings, book properties, make payments, and leave reviews.
- **Host**: Can register, list and manage properties, accept bookings, and receive payments.
- **Admin**: Can manage users, listings, and oversee bookings and system operations.
